### Notes:
 - As noted in link.md:
   - The only external script file that I myself coded for the unstyled blog page (crud.html) and styled blog page (styledcrud.html) is Assets/scripts/blog/blog.js. The underlying script for both is thus the same.
   - Assets/scripts/dist/purify.min.js is to include DOMPurify.
   - Assets/scripts/customdialog.js contains a script file for the custiom dialogs (customdialogs.html) page.
 - For implementation of the blog pages:
   - Notes as comments at the top of the above-mentioned blog.js file help explain overall how the code works. However, as details also given here: the script utilizies a template element, in which three primary elements reside: a blog-post element and two dialog elements. Two custom elements are used: this blog-post element, as well as a blog post container element. (The usage of custom elements seemed to make sense for this use case, as they are functioninig in ways unique to a blog post. A blog post is also an element that may be repeated, if there is more than one blog post). Blog posts are kept track of through a 'data-nth-post' data attribute on each blog post, as well as a 'data-num-posts' data attribute on the blog post container. 'data-num-posts' maintains the number of blog posts currently in the blog. 'data-nth-post' maintains the number of the current blog post, starting from 1 for the first blog post.
     - Whenever a blog post gets deleted, all blog posts "after" it in the HTML, and thus with higher data-nth-post attribute value, have that attribute be decremented (along with data-num-posts getting decremented also). In this way, the data-nth-post attributes across blog posts are always contiguous, starting from 1, and data-num-posts always maintains the number of blog posts, (assuming no user interference in dev tools of course). This is useful when identifying blog posts.
     - When a new blog post is added, it is cloned from the given blog-post in the template, and added to the page, with 'data-num-posts' being incremented, and with it having its data-nth-post be the subsequent integer. 
   - For more on how the dialogs work:
     - When a dialog is displayed, it is cloned from the template, added to the page, and shown in a modal fashion. 
     - There are two distinct dialogs. One is used both either if a user goes to edit a post, or whether they are creating a new post. The only difference is in the title, which is changed via a JS parameter.
       - For this dialog element that is used to edit or add a new blog post, its date-time is readonly, and always set to the current date-time. This was a design choice on my part, as I do not think that a user should be able to manually edit the date-time of their blog post (as that could be percieved as decieving if not the actual date/time they made the post). This field is also updated if they go to edit the post and confirm their choice. Editing a post thus updates the date-time of it, and again, in a readonly fashion.
       - The second dialog is used to confirm whether the user wished to delete that blog post.
      - When a dialog or blog-post is closed/deleted, it is removed from the page. A new one is thus cloned from template whenever another is to reappear/be-used.
    - Unless explicitly requested to be styled, I did not perform major styling of the blog posts or dialogs. However, I did add some background styling (such as a footer and background color) to match the general theme of the rest of the site. I did not, however, add main navigation to these pages (I was not sure how much styling was permitted), and so the backarrow must be used if wishing to navigate back to my main site (assuming one navigated to one of these dialog or blog pages from the "Experiments" page on my main site).

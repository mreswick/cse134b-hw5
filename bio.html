          I have always been interested in tinkering, creating, and engineering. When there is a dull moment, I will be sure to think up something
          that I can get my hands dirty with and apply my mind to. Before college, this was often with robots and drones. Now, it is more so with 
          the software. In either case, however, I have always loved being able to think through problems, and arrive at solutions.

          <p title="Inspiring people">
            I have been fortunate to be surrounded by inspiring people, regardless of circumstance, and even if from backgrounds that may seem
            unexpected. 
          </p>
          <div id="pWithAside" title="Different family backgrounds.">
            <aside id="musicBackgrounds">Interestingly, music actually plays a large role with multiple of my family members. My aunt is a professional 
              songwriter, my dad played country with both vocals and bass, and my mom is a trained classical (piano and violin) musician, having 
              attended conservatories since her childhood.
            </aside>
              <p id="pNextToAside"> Growing up, for example, was a split experience for me. My parents, for example, come from distinct backgrounds: my dad was raised
                in the U.S., born in Boston, while my mom is from the Ural Mountains in Russia. While my dad's dad was a graduate student at MIT and later
                a professor at what is now Case Western Reserve University, my mom's dad was working in the tank factories of World War II, building
                the infamous T-34's. But these differences continued on after their marriage, for before I was old enough to remember, they divorced
                and proceeded to live in separate spheres. With my dad, we lived on the semi-rural coast (the photo above, for example, was taken overlooking
                a nearby hillside, and our community only has about a thousand residents or so), whereas my mom lived "over-the-hill" in the 
                mainstay of the suburbs of Silicon Valley. And while my dad had transitioned into tech from administration, my mom worked (and still does)
                as a self-employed music teacher.</p>
    
            </div>
            <p title="Varied upbringing">
              The result was a varied upbringing. Where I attended school, for example, would often fluctuate. Sometimes I would be attending
              a school with a surf team within walking distance of the beach, while others, at least an hour or more away. This experience
              of the city, and the country, if you will, helped provide a broadened view of what opportunities lay before me. 
            </p> 
            <p title="Concurrent enrollment">
              As one example, I effectively transferred during high school to a community college (by transferring to a separate high school 
              so I could take concurrent enrollment courses full-time). This would expose me to the realms of the likes of multi-variable calculus,
              physics, and computer coding, in which I became fascinated. It all came at once: again I was fortunate to have amazing professors
              and be surrounded by highly-motivated students with similar interests.  
            </p>
            <p id="envLastP" title="Living workshop at home">
              All-the-meanwhile, I could always count on returning home to a living workshop. Having grown up with my dad has similarly exposed
              me to the passion and joy that comes with exercising creativity. At home, his dining room is often filled with audio equipment;
              his garage is a woodshop with electronics bench; two sheds outside the house have been allocated for photography and more
              electronics; the basement is devoted to photography, with printers taking up rooms, and an enlarging camera going through a wall;
              and my room had turned into a robotics bench of its own. Around us, too, were always works in progress, be it a truck reworked
              to run on alcohol (with dials covering the dash), and whatever else.

          <!-- Values -->
          <section id="valuesSec" title="Values">
            <h3>Values:</h3>
            <p id="valTop">
              From my time being raised through college, then, I have been privileged to have taken away a number of values that guide 
              me day-to-day. These have been as follows, in the order they build upon each other.
            </p>
            <ol id="valuesList" title="Values learned.">
              <li title="Curiosity"><i>Be curious:</i> it all starts with this. Gaining intrinsic reward from learning and utilizing
                the tools around us is what lays the foundation
              </li>
              <li title="Ownership"><i>Have ownership:</i> once you feel inspired, put the extra effort in to really master what
                comes your way. Further, take responsibility for what is yours, and be both practical but dedicated to
                tasks at hand.
              </li>
              <li title="Have fun."><i>Have fun:</i> creating things is enjoyable, and is what circles this list back to fuel the first
                item. It is a feedback-cycle, then, that helps me to continue to develop and feel gratified.
              </li>
            </ol>
            <p>
              I also am of the belief that the above values go a long way toward improving my own software development. Indeed, I 
              believe that coding should be treated as an engineering discipline. In that way, for example, users should be able
              to trust it, just as they would for physical public infrastructure, for example. It is thus my view that there is still
              much work to be done in the realm of software development to achieve this, but that if the above three principles can
              could be emphasized for the code that we write (particularly
              that of the second above), that the technical landscape would be improved.

                Of my amazing family members, I feel the particular need to honor <i>Shepi</i>, our golden retriever at home. I have
                always been raised with dogs in the household, but <em>she</em>is something else: her energy and puppy-nature, even at
                8 years of age, never ceases to surprise. 
              </p>
              <p id="familyPara">
                In addition, I owe my family a tremendous amount. They have largely shaped who I am today, and continue
                to provide their support at every turn.

              <h4>Hobbies:</h4>
              <p id="hobTopP">When some spare time comes my way, some things I love to do beyond coding and tinkering include:</p>
              <ul title="Things I do in my spare time.">
                <li title="The outdoors."><i>Heading outdoors:</i> at this point I am sure it has become spiritual. There is nothing like standing
                  at the foot of a redwood tree that towers hundreds of feet above you, and has been there for decade upon
                  decade, to be reminded of what vastness lays beyond oneself.
                </li>
                <li title="Photography and Videography."><i>Photography and Videography:</i> this stems partly from being engulfed in nature, but also comes from 
                  fascinations I have about other elements, such as light and scale. I am always amazed with how
                  something small can become a world in and of itself as well, and play with our understanding of size or otherwise
                  with our comprehension of the physical world. (Head over to 
                  my <a href="pastProjects.html" title="Previous Projects Page">Previous Projects</a> page, for example, to see some photos I have taken.)
                <li title="Chess."><i>Chess:</i> one of my favorite quick recreational activities remains as chess. The game has always been an integral
                  part of my life. In elementary and middle school, I received choaching weekly and compete in tournaments; and it remains
                  something I can often go to when down-time is of the essence. (Check out a page I link to from my <a href="pastProjects.html" title="Previous Projects Page">Previous Projects</a> page,
                  at <a href="chessforall.space">chessforall.space</a>, which is a site I created for a previous course to express my love for the game.)
                </li>
                <li title="Music."><i>Music:</i> this often goes very well with chess, by the way.</li>

        <p id="currentlyP">As mentioned also on the <a href="index.html" title="home page link">Home</a> page, but here in more detail, I am
        thrilled to accept my full-time offer at Amazon as a full-time software developer engineer. After the completion of my
        12-week internship (more about that on my <a href="experience.html" title="Misha's experiences' link">Experience</a> page), I am 
        happy to say that I will be able to return to the same team with which I had the pleasure to work with. This job being on
        the horizon, though being out-of-state for me currently, is exciting to think of. It will involve not only a change 
        of scenery, but also hopefully a development of me as a more skilled and capable engineer.

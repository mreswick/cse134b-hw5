              <p>As mentioned on my Bio page (link to it here), one of my favorite pastimes is the game of chess. In a previous CSE 125R course 
              that I took for public speaking in the online domain, I had the opportunity to create a whole site about the game

                In a previous writing course I took known as CAT3, we were tasked as a group of four to examine the intersection of music
                and future technology. Our group emphasized this intersection by music creators who are disabled or otherwise more
                physically limited, and created a site about it here: <a href="https://sites.google.com/ucsd.edu/cat3musandtech/home">Music and Tech</a>.

                Also available on this linked site is a soundscape that I and one other member co-created from other music clips, emphasizing those
                created by the physically disabled, and those who used novel technologies to create their sounds. <br>

                COVID began to take its toll here in the US during my second quarter at UCSD. In CAT 3, I was also tasked with
                self-creating a soundscape to reflect on the times. In particular, I focused on the dominance that machines have over aspects as mundane as heating our food.<br>

                    The higher the robot could place the boxes on these shelves, the greater our team's score. See our robot in a trial run here:
